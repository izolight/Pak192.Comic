length=5
#Length of the vehicle in 1/16 tiles.
#1 length translates into the vehicle being 6px long in N,S,E,W directions, 4px long in NW and SE directions and 8px long in NE and SW directions.
#length=8 is special in the way that it's the only length that works with just 4 images per vehicle
#length=8 is half a tile, length=16 is a full tile.
#length=12 is a 26,4m long IC coach. Most vehicles try to use the same scale. So 1 lenght roughly translate into 2,2 real life meters

#freight the vehicle can load. Use "none" in case the vehicle shall not carry a freigth.
#Use "freight=Passagiere" for none-freigth-vehicles that shall appear outside the locomotive tab

payload=5
#How many units of the freight fit in the vehicle

loading_time=750
