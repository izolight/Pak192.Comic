#The unused folder

Sometimes there are graphics which fit the pak quality standards, but for whatever reason never made it in the set. Be it that the original creator is a pure artist who does not really know how dats work, or simply has other stuff to do that occupies their atttention.
Those graphics sometimes end up in the materials/unused directory and are up for adoption... or adaptation, in this case both mean to create and test a dat-file for the graphic and thereby creating a new object for the game.
